1. The automation files are in build/Build_automation_release.
   There are four files:
    (A). args.xml - This is the file where you need to enter the values used during automation.
    (B). HSAN_build_Automation.py - The main script that will be executed for automation to start.
    (C). readme - This file.
    (D). sendMail.py - To send the mail, but you don't need to use it anyway.
    (E). start_build - if you've given time and script in the args file then you need to execute this file.

    The above files need to stick together in checkout_path/Build_automation_release directory.

2. Please make sure you put AutoBoot_Script_V02_POWER_afterNonAuto.sh in checkout path, it's name is the exact as given here,
   it's chmod is 777 and it contains the absolute path of args.xml file.

3. Please make sure to have the path to README, App2300_R333_1.129604.tkf and Power_MIB file in the path given in path_for_mib_readme_tkf item of args.xml.

4. Please make sure that you change the owner permission of the checked out project to current user before executing the script(i.e. necuser).

5. DO NOT run the script as root. It'll cause the build to fail.

6. The shadow server should have the ssh key installed in order to send the LTU package to it.

7. Run the HSAN_build_Automation.py by traversing to Build_automation_release dir and using 'python HSAN_build_Automation.py'
   at terminal.
